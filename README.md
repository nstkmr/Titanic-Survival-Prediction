# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. The project uses supervised learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier, trained on the famous Titanic dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets for getting started with data science and machine learning.  
This project walks through the full workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison across models

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  

**Key features include:**
- Passenger class (Pclass)  
- Name, Sex, Age  
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)  
- Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)  
- Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Port of Embarkation (Embarked)  

**Target Variable:**  
- `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
